<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community.

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community. The Task Force produced the <a href=""https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-on-community-policing"">Public Safety and Community Policing Report</a> with 23 recommendations. <a href=""https://view.email.umd.edu/?qs=2a205c4c057d9406481efde22ff415249bf7e067dd85c81717a8102053f0ddc214d4c0838ade10d68293db49336d5c4247c14e8017fbf16b3f52aea0417a0a7fddd8b2c6be740071dca5bb3025dcc499"">President Pines announced in March 2022</a> that UMD would begin implementation of the recommendations with two modifications. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions.

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community. The Task Force produced the <a href=""https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-on-community-policing"">Public Safety and Community Policing Report</a> with 23 recommendations. <a href=""https://view.email.umd.edu/?qs=2a205c4c057d9406481efde22ff415249bf7e067dd85c81717a8102053f0ddc214d4c0838ade10d68293db49336d5c4247c14e8017fbf16b3f52aea0417a0a7fddd8b2c6be740071dca5bb3025dcc499"">President Pines announced in March 2022</a> that UMD would begin implementation of the recommendations with two modifications. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
</div>, <div class=""rich-text"" data-modal=""body"">
<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community. The Task Force produced the <a href=""https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-on-community-policing"">Public Safety and Community Policing Report</a> with 23 recommendations. <a href=""https://view.email.umd.edu/?qs=2a205c4c057d9406481efde22ff415249bf7e067dd85c81717a8102053f0ddc214d4c0838ade10d68293db49336d5c4247c14e8017fbf16b3f52aea0417a0a7fddd8b2c6be740071dca5bb3025dcc499"">President Pines announced in March 2022</a> that UMD would begin implementation of the recommendations with two modifications. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community.

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community.

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
</div>, <div class=""rich-text"" data-modal=""body"">
<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community. The Task Force produced the <a href=""https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-on-community-policing"">Public Safety and Community Policing Report</a> with 23 recommendations. <a href=""https://view.email.umd.edu/?qs=2a205c4c057d9406481efde22ff415249bf7e067dd85c81717a8102053f0ddc214d4c0838ade10d68293db49336d5c4247c14e8017fbf16b3f52aea0417a0a7fddd8b2c6be740071dca5bb3025dcc499"">President Pines announced in March 2022</a> that UMD would begin implementation of the recommendations with two modifications. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
</div>, <div class=""rich-text"" data-modal=""body"">
<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community. The Task Force produced the <a href=""https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-on-community-policing"">Public Safety and Community Policing Report</a> with 23 recommendations. <a href=""https://view.email.umd.edu/?qs=2a205c4c057d9406481efde22ff415249bf7e067dd85c81717a8102053f0ddc214d4c0838ade10d68293db49336d5c4247c14e8017fbf16b3f52aea0417a0a7fddd8b2c6be740071dca5bb3025dcc499"">President Pines announced in March 2022</a> that UMD would begin implementation of the recommendations with two modifications. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community.

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity.

<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
</div>, <div class=""rich-text"" data-modal=""body"">
<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community. The Task Force produced the <a href=""https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-on-community-policing"">Public Safety and Community Policing Report</a> with 23 recommendations. <a href=""https://view.email.umd.edu/?qs=2a205c4c057d9406481efde22ff415249bf7e067dd85c81717a8102053f0ddc214d4c0838ade10d68293db49336d5c4247c14e8017fbf16b3f52aea0417a0a7fddd8b2c6be740071dca5bb3025dcc499"">President Pines announced in March 2022</a> that UMD would begin implementation of the recommendations with two modifications. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
</div>, <div class=""rich-text"" data-modal=""body"">
<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community. The Task Force produced the <a href=""https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-on-community-policing"">Public Safety and Community Policing Report</a> with 23 recommendations. <a href=""https://view.email.umd.edu/?qs=2a205c4c057d9406481efde22ff415249bf7e067dd85c81717a8102053f0ddc214d4c0838ade10d68293db49336d5c4247c14e8017fbf16b3f52aea0417a0a7fddd8b2c6be740071dca5bb3025dcc499"">President Pines announced in March 2022</a> that UMD would begin implementation of the recommendations with two modifications. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community.

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity.

<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
</div>, <div class=""rich-text"" data-modal=""body"">
<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community. The Task Force produced the <a href=""https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-on-community-policing"">Public Safety and Community Policing Report</a> with 23 recommendations. <a href=""https://view.email.umd.edu/?qs=2a205c4c057d9406481efde22ff415249bf7e067dd85c81717a8102053f0ddc214d4c0838ade10d68293db49336d5c4247c14e8017fbf16b3f52aea0417a0a7fddd8b2c6be740071dca5bb3025dcc499"">President Pines announced in March 2022</a> that UMD would begin implementation of the recommendations with two modifications. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
</div>, <div class=""rich-text"" data-modal=""body"">
<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community. The Task Force produced the <a href=""https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-on-community-policing"">Public Safety and Community Policing Report</a> with 23 recommendations. <a href=""https://view.email.umd.edu/?qs=2a205c4c057d9406481efde22ff415249bf7e067dd85c81717a8102053f0ddc214d4c0838ade10d68293db49336d5c4247c14e8017fbf16b3f52aea0417a0a7fddd8b2c6be740071dca5bb3025dcc499"">President Pines announced in March 2022</a> that UMD would begin implementation of the recommendations with two modifications. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community.

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity.

<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
</div>, <div class=""rich-text"" data-modal=""body"">
<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community. The Task Force produced the <a href=""https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-on-community-policing"">Public Safety and Community Policing Report</a> with 23 recommendations. <a href=""https://view.email.umd.edu/?qs=2a205c4c057d9406481efde22ff415249bf7e067dd85c81717a8102053f0ddc214d4c0838ade10d68293db49336d5c4247c14e8017fbf16b3f52aea0417a0a7fddd8b2c6be740071dca5bb3025dcc499"">President Pines announced in March 2022</a> that UMD would begin implementation of the recommendations with two modifications. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
</div>, <div class=""rich-text"" data-modal=""body"">
<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community. The Task Force produced the <a href=""https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-on-community-policing"">Public Safety and Community Policing Report</a> with 23 recommendations. <a href=""https://view.email.umd.edu/?qs=2a205c4c057d9406481efde22ff415249bf7e067dd85c81717a8102053f0ddc214d4c0838ade10d68293db49336d5c4247c14e8017fbf16b3f52aea0417a0a7fddd8b2c6be740071dca5bb3025dcc499"">President Pines announced in March 2022</a> that UMD would begin implementation of the recommendations with two modifications. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community.

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity.

<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
</div>, <div class=""rich-text"" data-modal=""body"">
<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community. The Task Force produced the <a href=""https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-on-community-policing"">Public Safety and Community Policing Report</a> with 23 recommendations. <a href=""https://view.email.umd.edu/?qs=2a205c4c057d9406481efde22ff415249bf7e067dd85c81717a8102053f0ddc214d4c0838ade10d68293db49336d5c4247c14e8017fbf16b3f52aea0417a0a7fddd8b2c6be740071dca5bb3025dcc499"">President Pines announced in March 2022</a> that UMD would begin implementation of the recommendations with two modifications. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
</div>, <div class=""rich-text"" data-modal=""body"">
<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community. The Task Force produced the <a href=""https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-on-community-policing"">Public Safety and Community Policing Report</a> with 23 recommendations. <a href=""https://view.email.umd.edu/?qs=2a205c4c057d9406481efde22ff415249bf7e067dd85c81717a8102053f0ddc214d4c0838ade10d68293db49336d5c4247c14e8017fbf16b3f52aea0417a0a7fddd8b2c6be740071dca5bb3025dcc499"">President Pines announced in March 2022</a> that UMD would begin implementation of the recommendations with two modifications. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>

<p>We have clearly communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority and are developing financial incentives to enable us to compete with other employers. Our goal is to be a clear leader among AAU universities in the diversity of our faculty, staff and student body. The university has continued to seek out and make offers to underrepresented faculty. In addition, the university hired a new dean and two new department chairs in 2021 who bring diversity to our academic leadership. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The University of Maryland launched the FAMILE (Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence) faculty diversity hiring initiative in March 2021. Through FAMILE, the University will invest $40 million over 10 years to diversify its tenured and tenure track faculty. As of April 2022, 15 faculty members (11 assistant professors, three associate professors and one full professor) from underrepresented populations have been hired through the FAMILE initiative. This is double the number (7) last reported on this site. A third round of FAMILE proposals is anticipated in April 2022. <br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 77 in Fall 2021 to 89 in Fall 2022, for an increase of 13.5%. Since Fall 2015, the number of tenured/tenure track faculty who identify as Black/African American has increased from 72, for an increase of 19.1%. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are strengthening our efforts to increase the number of Black Ph.D. students, including initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion to recruit and support students from underrepresented populations; the new President’s Fellowship, for which 40 award offers were made this spring (23 to Black students); and a program to match college/department enhancements to students from underrepresented groups. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
</div>, <div class=""rich-text"" data-modal=""body"">
<p>The TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program has been developed and officially launched in July 2021 for new faculty and staff and August 2021 for students. The onboarding program includes resources in bias incident reporting, counseling services and additional resources for BIPOC. <strong>[Sustained <strong>Commitment</strong>]</strong><br/><br/>In addition, the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI) is: working with the Diversity Education Task Force to provide content focused on racial bias for incorporation into courses; working with Faculty Affairs and other units on implicit bias training; and sponsoring a series of anti-racism teach-ins featuring faculty, staff and students. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>President Pines established the University of Maryland Task Force on Community Policing to provide recommendations to enhance public safety and community policing that help the UMD campus move toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and the university community. The Task Force produced the <a href=""https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-on-community-policing"">Public Safety and Community Policing Report</a> with 23 recommendations. <a href=""https://view.email.umd.edu/?qs=2a205c4c057d9406481efde22ff415249bf7e067dd85c81717a8102053f0ddc214d4c0838ade10d68293db49336d5c4247c14e8017fbf16b3f52aea0417a0a7fddd8b2c6be740071dca5bb3025dcc499"">President Pines announced in March 2022</a> that UMD would begin implementation of the recommendations with two modifications. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p>When threatening and intimidating action takes place, the university will seek to impose sanctions and involve the Office of Student Conduct, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, or University of Maryland Police Department, as appropriate. The Division of Student Affairs (DSA) has formed a workgroup with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to review DSA policies and protocols involving bias and hate incidents and work to establish a common language amongst all DSA departments. The workgroup has created the DSA Hate-Bias Response Guide which will assist departments in educating employees about free speech protections, enhance awareness, and quicken response time on staff addressing hateful speech and instill the responsibility of reporting unwanted behavior and actions that oppose our campus values. This guide is currently in final review as of April 2022 and will be widely distributed across campus. DSA and the Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) will continue to work in collaboration to offer educational opportunities for staff and students to increase their understanding of freedom of speech, student activism, BISS services, and hate-bias incidents. DSA will also continue to be in partnership with Academic Affairs to keep them informed of the development of our policies to aim for uniformity. BISS also has a Hate-Bias Response Team Student Advisory Group, which advises and provides recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of BISS.<strong> [Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>The counseling center and behavioral health services of the health center have always been intentional in keeping diversity considerations central to any hiring decisions. The staff at the centers are diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, sexual identities, gender identities, neurodiversities, and other aspects of diversity. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong><br/><br/>Diversity considerations will continue to be central as the Counseling Center conducts searches for additional psychologists in spring 2022. <strong>[In Progress]</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recruiting and retaining a diverse student body is a top priority for the university. The University of Maryland has implemented many new efforts and programs to build strong partnerships with Prince George's County and Washington DC to recruit Black students.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) is not allowed to establish numeric enrollment goals by race, it is our clear intention to improve the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of African American students from our home county. While there is much work to be done, the previous and current efforts have begun to have an impressive impact. From the fall of 2017 to the fall of 2021, the number of Black/African American freshmen admitted for the fall semester has increased by 40%. While we are encouraged by this increase, the number of students who have chosen to enroll has not followed a similar increase and the number of enrolled Black/African American students has realized little change during the same time period. As a result, OUA continues to focus its efforts on improving the yield rate among the students who have been successfully recruited and admitted to the university. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to the approaches already in place (all of which continue), OUA has undertaken and/or enhanced a number of efforts to target outreach efforts in Prince George’s County. For example:</p>
<ul><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Now A Terp Mixer for Admitted Students: Evening reception at The Hotel designed to encourage freshman enrollment for African American and Latinx Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment defense efforts: personalized outreach efforts designed to address student questions or rectify any outstanding issues that may be hindering enrollment for county residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College Access Conference: While not restricted to Prince George’s County, this day-long college application workshop for rising high school seniors will return to an in-person event (subject to COVID restrictions) targeting African American, Latinx and Native American Maryland residents and will have enhanced outreach efforts for Prince George’s County residents.</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College application workshops, held at the request of school counselors throughout the county</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">College readiness summer bootcamps, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Essay writing workshops, held at the request of the PGCPS Office of College Readiness and Student Services</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">High school visits (held virtually and in person throughout the county)</p></li><li dir=""ltr""><p dir=""ltr"">Maryland Ascent Program</p></li></ul>

<p>The Career Center (CC) continues to convene diversity, equity and inclusion partners on campus to gather input on what is needed to improve our career resources for Black students, and have engaged the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in these discussions as well. The CC has established regular meetings on this topic with Black student leaders and created the Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity Advisory (IDEA) Board with a budget of $10,000 to fund new proposals for programs and resources dedicated towards addressing the career development needs of Black students. There are several existing career programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu, such as the Working While Black series. We will continue to work on coordinated efforts that will lead to actionable items to enhance engagement with Black students related to career opportunities. Partners for those efforts include MICA, OMSE, IAP, AAP, Nyumburu, Student Success Initiative, Black Honors Caucus, and Center for Minorities in Engineering. <strong>[Sustained Commitment]</strong></p>

<p>Under current campus policies, allegations of discrimination by faculty are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), and allegations of hate bias by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs, pursuant to the University's Policy of Threatening and Intimidating Conduct, which is overseen by the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion (ODI). Just as students are, faculty can be sanctioned only after a process that comports with due process and the First Amendment. In addition, just as student dicipline matters are privacy protected, faculty sanctions are also protected as confidential personnel matters. An oversight committee to evaluate and monitor faculty discriminatory behavior is inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative of these established processes and procedures, which were approved by our University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff. <strong>[Completed]</strong></p>
